 💡so...what is shaga?✋🥺
 Shaga is a **peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud gaming platform**.
Big words? Don’t worry. I got you.
Traditional cloud gaming means you stream games from a big centralized server (like Google Stadia or Xbox Cloud). That setup is expensive, power-hungry, and kinda limited.
 
Shaga said “nah.” Instead of massive data centers, they let **people share their own idle devices** — laptops, desktops, even consoles — to power other gamers’ experiences.
 
⚡ Think: Airbnb, but for gaming hardware.
